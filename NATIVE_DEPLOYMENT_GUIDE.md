## üß™ Testing Volume Key Control

### After Installation:

1. **Open the app on your device**

2. **Complete onboarding** (if first time)
   - Enter your name
   - Set up your first practice
   - Complete the affirmation step

3. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Tap the Settings icon in the bottom navigation

4. **Enable Volume Key Control**
   - Toggle "Volume Key Control" to ON
   - You should see a success toast: "Volume buttons enabled! Use volume keys to count."

5. **Return to Home Screen**
   - Go back to the main counter screen

6. **Test Volume Buttons**
   - **Press Volume UP** ‚Üí Counter should increment (+1)
   - **Press Volume DOWN** ‚Üí Counter should decrement (-1)
   - Changes should be reflected immediately in the app

### Check Console Logs (Optional):

If you want to see detailed logs:

**Android:**
```bash
# In a terminal
npx cap run android --livereload

# Or use Android Studio's Logcat viewer
```

**iOS:**
```bash
# Use Xcode's console output
# Or Safari Web Inspector (for debugging)
```

You should see logs like:
```
üîß Setting up volume key control...
‚úÖ Volume buttons watcher started successfully!
üì± Press Volume UP to increment, Volume DOWN to decrement
üîº Volume UP pressed - incrementing count
üîΩ Volume DOWN pressed - decrementing count
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Volume Buttons Not Working?

1. **Ensure Volume Control is ON** in Settings
2. **Verify you have an active practice** selected
3. **Check you're on the Home/Counter screen**
4. **Make sure the app is in foreground** (not in background)
5. **Try disabling and re-enabling** the setting
6. **Restart the app** if needed

### Build Errors?

**Android:**
```bash
cd /app/android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npm run build
npx cap sync android
```

**iOS:**
```bash
cd /app/ios/App
pod install --repo-update
cd ../..
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
```

### Permission Issues?

The app doesn't require any special permissions for volume button control on Android/iOS. It should work out of the box.

   ```

2. **Rebuild web assets**
   ```bash
   cd /app
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Sync to native projects**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   ```

4. **Run on device again**
   - Android: `npx cap open android` ‚Üí Run
   - iOS: `npx cap open ios` ‚Üí Run
